# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: Dec 07, 2025 Sunday


**Today's Progress**: Make a repository for advent of code.

**Thoughts:** I do my first problem of advent of code with python, a really struggled with this language, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it.

### Day 1: Dec 08, 2025 Monday


**Today's Progress**: Second star in day 1? of advent of code.

**Thoughts:** I've just gotten the second star for Day 1 of Advent of Code. It took me a while to figure out the logic for counting the negative numbers. My code still has a lot of repetition, but I'll clean up the logic over time.

**Today's Progress**: First star in day 2 of advent of code.

**Thoughts:** I had a bit of trouble understanding today’s task because of my English, but I think I’m doing really well in this challenge and I’ve learned a lot of new Python tricks.

### Day 4: Dec 11, 2025 Wednesday FAIL


### Day 5: Dec 12, 2025 Wednesday 00:30


**Today's Progress**: First star in day 3 of advent of code.

**Thoughts:** I lost the day because I went out with friends to a party and got home after the deadline. I felt pretty guilty, but I ended up doing Advent of Code at midnight. It was a bit easier, but I hope to improve.
