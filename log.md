### Day 1: Dec 08, 2025 Monday


**Today's Progress**: Second star in day 1? of advent of code.

**Thoughts:** I've just gotten the second star for Day 1 of Advent of Code. It took me a while to figure out the logic for counting the negative numbers. My code still has a lot of repetition, but I'll clean up the logic over time.

**Today's Progress**: First star in day 2 of advent of code.

**Thoughts:** I had a bit of trouble understanding today’s task because of my English, but I think I’m doing really well in this challenge and I’ve learned a lot of new Python tricks.
